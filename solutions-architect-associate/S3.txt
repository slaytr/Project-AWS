Versioning
- Stores all versions of objects, even after delete
- Backup tool
- Lifecycle rules
- Cannot be disabled once enabled, only suspended
- MFA Delete

Stores all versions of an object - including all writes and deletes

Lifecycle
Automate moving objects between storage tiers
Can be used in conjuction with versioning
Can be applied to 
- current versions and  
- previous versions

Cross Region Replication 
- Dif Regions | Regions must be unique/different
- Requires Versioning | Versioning must be enabled on source and destination
- Existing files are not copied over on enable
- Subsequent updated files will be replicated
- Delete markers are not replicated
- Deleting versions will not be replicated
